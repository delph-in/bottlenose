# bottlenose

This is an implementation of the
[DELPH-IN RESTful API](http://moin.delph-in.net/ErgApi)
using ACE and pyDelphin as the backend.

## Requirements

- [ACE](http://sweaglesw.org/linguistics/ace/)
- [pyDelphin](https://github.com/delph-in/pydelphin)
- [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org)

## Disclaimer

Bottlenose currently only implements a subset of the functions defined
by the [API](http://moin.delph-in.net/ErgApi).
Notably, it currently lacks support for
[Elementary Dependency Structures](http://moin.delph-in.net/EdsTop).
